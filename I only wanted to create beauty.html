                <p>The most joy I get from life is when creating. When I’m all alone divorced of all life’s troubles solely focused on my craft. My happiest moments in life (aside from the moments when I was near her) were when I was in a flow state, not feeling like I’m human and just letting whatever the universe was feeling flow through me.</p>
                
                <h3></h3>
                <p>I loved drawing and painting even though I sucked at it. Actually, right now while I’m writing I am feeling a little bit happy. I loved creating robots and learning. God, I love learning so much.</p>

                
                <p>I’m so tired of people. I think I am going to quit everything in two days.</p>

                <p>I genuinely I believe I am meant to create and to create only. I am not meant to have human relationships whether platonic or not. All I have been doing the past 18 years aside from sharpening skills was a mistake, including all the relationships I had. I just wish I had the guts to cut off everything that doesn’t involve designing. The problem is I just know people will come up with the dumbest reasons for what I’m doing, and I hate when people talk about me.</p>
                <p>I just want to read, learn, and build all day. </p>
